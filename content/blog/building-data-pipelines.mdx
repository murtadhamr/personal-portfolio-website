## Introduction

Data pipelines are the backbone of modern data infrastructure. In this article, we'll explore how to build robust ETL workflows using **Apache Airflow** and **Python**.

## Why Airflow?

Apache Airflow provides a platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. Its key advantages include:

- **Dynamic pipeline generation** — pipelines are defined as code
- **Extensibility** — custom operators and hooks
- **Rich UI** — for monitoring and debugging

## Setting Up the Pipeline

First, let's define our DAG structure:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

default_args = {
    'owner': 'data-team',
    'start_date': datetime(2026, 1, 1),
    'retries': 3,
}

dag = DAG(
    'etl_pipeline',
    default_args=default_args,
    schedule_interval='@daily',
)
```

## Data Extraction

The extraction phase connects to various data sources — APIs, databases, and file systems:

```python
def extract_data(**kwargs):
    """Extract data from source systems."""
    import requests
    response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
    return response.json()
```

## Transformation & Loading

Once data is extracted, we apply transformations and load into our data warehouse:

```sql
INSERT INTO analytics.daily_metrics
SELECT
    date_trunc('day', event_timestamp) as event_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as unique_users,
    SUM(revenue) as total_revenue
FROM raw.events
WHERE event_timestamp >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 day'
GROUP BY 1;
```

## Conclusion

Building reliable data pipelines requires careful consideration of error handling, monitoring, and scalability. Airflow provides the tools to manage this complexity effectively.
